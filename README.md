# Sandbox

The purpose of Sandbox is to be a repository of one-off, simple, usually single-file, examples of what are usually core engineering techniques (i.e., a simple game engine in PyGame, or an HTML websocket to send and receive data to a browser, or a web-scraping tool using Selenium in instances when Requests itself will not work even with cookies). The repository is not intended to be a dumping ground of experiments run, although the code is not gauranteed to run or be bug-proof. If the code does contain bugs, please create a ticket or ask for a pull request or, better yet, take the code into a codegen and ask for code changes to repair the bugs then create a ticket with that information and ask for a pull request. If you really get what we are doing here you might know by how we approach these problems.
